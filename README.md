## About

Wheelix is a fully functional car rental website. Its dynamic nature incorporates various technologies to provide users with a seamless rental experience.

Wheelix has two application layers: 1) ASP.NET API layer that efficiently communicates with the Microsoft SQL Server database and 2) the Angular front-end layer. This powerful combination enables the application to deliver real-time data and interactions to our users.

When you land on the home page, the application utilizes the IP Stack API (https://ipstack.com/) to determine the user's GEO location based on its current IP address. This feature allows us to personalize the user experience by showing you the nearest Wheelix store locations for easy pick-up and return of the chosen vehicle.

Upon selecting your preferred pick-up date, return date, age, and location, the application uses the provided information to display the closest Wheelix store on a Leaflet map. Additionally, you will find convenient cards referencing each location on the map. You can either select a location directly or view it on the map.

Once you have chosen a location, the user-friendly interface allows you to browse through a wide range of available vehicles. The vehicle information, along with additional options, is fetched from the database using APIs.

A simple confirmation process triggers another API call, storing all the necessary information securely in the database. This ensures that the rental details are recorded accurately and can be accessed whenever needed.

To facilitate easy management of the rental, the website provides the user with a unique Rental Number, which can be used with the registered email to effortlessly retrieve all the relevant details of the rental. Whether you want to modify your booking, cancel it, or simply print your rental order, the system is designed to cater to the user's needs efficiently.
